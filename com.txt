I woke up feeling exhausted, and no matter how much coffee I drank, I couldn't shake the heaviness in my chest. Work was overwhelming, and every little mistake I made felt like proof that I'm not good enough. No one seemed to notice how much I was struggling, and I didn't want to burden anyone by saying anything. By the time I got home, I felt completely drained, like I had nothing left to give. I tried distracting myself with a movie, but my mind kept wandering back to everything that went wrong. I just feel so alone, like I'm screaming into a void and no one even hears me. I donâ€™t know how to pull myself out of this feeling.\"}"
